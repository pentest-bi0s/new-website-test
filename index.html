          <h3>Red Teaming</h3>
          <p>On the Red Team, we simulate real-world attacks to uncover weak spots before adversaries do. It's offensive security — hands-on, high stakes, and always evolving. We think like attackers, so defenders can stay ahead.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="sub-team-card">
          <h3>Mobile Security</h3>
          <p>From tearing down mobile binaries to analyzing malware and exploiting flaws in mobile systems, we dig deep into how apps work — and where they fail. It's hands-on work that exposes the inner mechanics most users never see.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="sub-team-card">
          <h3>Blockchain Security</h3>
          <p>Decentralization doesn't guarantee safety — we prove that by uncovering logic bugs, exploitation paths, and design flaws in blockchain tech. It's fast-paced, experimental, and constantly evolving. We're deep in the code where trust meets risk.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="sub-team-card">
          <h3>Cloud Security</h3>
          <p>We challenge the assumptions the cloud is built on. Behind layers of abstraction lie trust boundaries waiting to be broken. We dig into the gaps others overlook — misconfigurations, flawed logic, and hidden risks — and turn them into entry points.</p>
